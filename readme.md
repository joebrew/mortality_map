Products: 2 maps (2010 and 2012)

1.      HIV prevalence according to AFEPI 2010/2012 survey overlayed on mortality of 18-50 year olds of the corresponding year.

2.      They also requested crude tabulated data for each mapping unit (barrio I suppose):

a.      Denominator (n° of 18-50 in barrio unit), proportion of M/F and age distribution of 18-50yr olds, n° deaths 18-50, n° who had HIV test, n° HIV positive,

I will send you the AFEPI data which has perm_id, house number, sex, age, HIV serostatus and I am not sure if it has GIS coordinates but otherwise can be merged with DSS for coordinates. It was only in what they refer to as “antiga area” so does not include Ilha Josina, Taninga etc….so these maps will overlay mortality only for the areas covered in Afepi.

For mortality data, I guess that will come from the DSS database (member) with GIS coordinates for the DTHs (18-50 yr olds) of 2010 and 2012 and the crude data for each mapping unit in that year…I imagine if Faustino made a map of mortality, he has that data for those years. Enclosed is a map Faustino made for our collaborators for deaths in 2015. I imagine it would be something like this with HIV prevalence overlayed?

I hope this helps! I will send an email to our collaborators copying you, charfu and Faustino to put you into contact with Peter Rodriguez, their GIS man and I’ll send you the Afepi data.
